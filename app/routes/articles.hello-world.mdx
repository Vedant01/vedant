## The AI-Powered Development Stack

In today's rapidly evolving tech landscape, AI tools have become indispensable allies for developers. For my portfolio website, I embraced several cutting-edge AI tools that significantly enhanced my development process:

### 1. Cursor: The AI-Powered IDE

Cursor has revolutionized my development workflow. Its AI capabilities provide:
- Intelligent code completion and suggestions
- Context-aware documentation
- Real-time error detection and fixes
- Seamless integration with version control

The ability to have natural language conversations about code directly in my IDE has been transformative, making complex implementations more approachable.

### 2. ChatGPT: The Coding Companion

ChatGPT served as my virtual pair programmer, helping with:
- Code architecture decisions
- Debugging complex issues
- Generating boilerplate code
- Explaining technical concepts
- Writing documentation

Its ability to understand context and provide detailed explanations made it an invaluable resource throughout development.

### 3. Perplexity: Research and Learning

Perplexity helped me:
- Research best practices for modern web development
- Stay updated with the latest technologies
- Find solutions to specific technical challenges
- Understand complex concepts through clear explanations

### 4. Krea: Design and UI Enhancement

Krea's AI capabilities assisted in:
- Generating design assets
- Creating responsive layouts
- Optimizing user experience
- Suggesting color schemes and typography

### 5. Supabase: Backend and Authentication

While not strictly an AI tool, Supabase's modern approach to backend development complemented our AI-powered frontend:
- Real-time database capabilities
- Authentication and authorization
- File storage
- Edge functions
